This is the first project of the Foundations course from the Odin Project, its just a website meant to build HTML skills.

The website will consist of an index with various links to different recipes, effectively making it a web recipe book. 

After adding 4 recipes and finishing this part, I realize I'm not really good at explaining cooking nor do I understand how to make picadillo properly. But lists are really useful nevertheless.
