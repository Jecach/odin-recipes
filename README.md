This is the first project of the Foundations course from the Odin Project, its just a website meant to build HTML skills.

The website will consist of an index with various links to different recipes, effectively making it a web recipe book. 


After adding some recipes, I realize I'm not really good at explaining cooking nor do I understand how to make picadillo properly.
